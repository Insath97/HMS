# Hotel Management System

## Overview

For my diploma final project at Wayamba University, I developed a Hotel Management System using Java Swing. This comprehensive system efficiently handled hotel operations, encompassing room booking and reservations, front desk operations, customer management, room management, and employee administration. It effectively managed guest check-in and check-out status, streamlined bill issuance, and provided a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation.

## Features

- **Room Booking and Reservations**: Allows customers to book rooms in advance and manage reservations.
- **Front Desk Operations**: Provides functionality for managing check-in, check-out, and room assignments.
- **Customer Management**: Stores guest information and booking history for improved customer service.
- **Room Management**: Tracks room availability, status, and maintenance schedules.
- **Employee Administration**: Manages staff information, roles, and responsibilities within the hotel.
- **Billing System**: Generates bills for guests based on their stay duration and additional services.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: Graphical user interface toolkit for Java applications.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system for storing hotel data.

## Installation
